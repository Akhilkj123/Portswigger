**SUBVERYING APPLICATION LOGIC**

 Consider an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'hello' AND password = 'hello'

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected. 

When the shopping website is being opened, it shows page as such.

We are here to conduct a SQL Injection to login into a website without password.

When we randomly enter a username and password the burpsuiter caputures the page as such

Here the query made is 
- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'admin'

So, we change the query to
- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = 'any text' 

which logs us into the website with admin privilege
