**RETRIEVING HIDDEN DATA**

 Consider a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts

The query will be present in this format

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1, where
- '*' - all details

The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably released = 0

Now we perform the SQL Injection using Burpsuite

 Now we can cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about by initiating the fllowing query:
 
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--

Here, the query is changed to 

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1

The modified query will return all items where either the category is Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. Since 1=1 is always true, the query will return all items.
