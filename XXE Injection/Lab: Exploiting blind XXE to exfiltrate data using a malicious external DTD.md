- Consider a shopping application that has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result. Our aim is to exfiltrate the contents of the /etc/hostname file.

- Now we place the Burp Collaborator payload into a malicious DTD file

- We need to exploit the stock checker feature by adding a parameter entity referring to the malicious DTD. We insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element

- We will see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.
